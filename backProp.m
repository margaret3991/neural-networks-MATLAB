function [ mse ] = backProp(trainInputs,trainTargets, learningRate, iterations, architecture)
%UNTITLED4 Summary of this function goes here
%   Detailed explanation goes here
%   trainInputs = input vector for training set 
%   trainTargets = target vector for training set
%   learning rate = alpha learning rate 
%   iterations = set value for maximum iterations 
%   architecture = vector representing number of neurons and layers for the
%       neural network i.e. [2 1] for a 1-2-1 pattern (doesn't count input)

%   transfer function definitions:
%   layer1 function: logsigmoid()
%   layer2 function: linear() 



outputArg2 = inputArg2;
